# üß† **ChEpred**: Cholinesterase Inhibitor Prediction Using AttentiveFP

**ChEpred** is a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based tool designed to predict the inhibitory activity of chemical compounds against **acetylcholinesterase (AChE)** and **butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE)**. Using molecular structures provided in **SMILES format**, the tool performs binary classification (Inhibitor vs. Non-inhibitor) as well as multi-classification for potency of inhibitors and provides **atom-level and bond-level interpretability** through importance graphs and visualizations.

**ChEpred** is distributed as a user-friendly **Docker container**, making it easy to use without any setup. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or student, the web interface and containerized environment ensure accessible and reproducible predictions.

## üì¶ Installation

### 1. Install Docker

#### For Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
wsl --install
```

Then inside WSL:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker.io -y
```

#### For Linux

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker.io -y
```

### üì¶ Dependencies

All dependencies are pre-installed in the Docker image. You only need Docker installed on your system.

---

## üß™ Usage

### 2. Run the Docker Container

Navigate to your working directory and launch the container:

#### CPU-only version:

```bash
sudo docker run -it --rm -v ${PWD}:/workspace ghcr.io/pip700/chepred:cpu
```

#### GPU-enabled version:

```bash
sudo docker run --gpus all -it --rm -v ${PWD}:/workspace ghcr.io/pip700/chepred:gpu
```

### 3. Input File Selection

Once inside the Docker container, choose input format:

* Enter `1` to input a **SMILES** string directly:

  ```scores
  CC(C)OC(=O)N1CCC(CC1)CN2C=NC3=CC=CC=C3C2=O
  ```

* Enter `2` to upload a **CSV** file containing SMILES:

  ```
  inhibitors.csv
  ```

> The CSV file **must contain a column** with valid SMILES strings.

---

## üì§ Output Results

All output files are saved in a **timestamped folder** in your working directory.

### Outputs Include:

* `Prediction.csv` ‚Äî Predicted class [Is Active (True): Inhibitor / Is Active (False): Non-inhibitor) and probabilities
* `Atom & Bond-level.png` ‚Äî Visualization of atom and bond significance
* `Feature importance.png` ‚Äî Visualization of histogram of node features
